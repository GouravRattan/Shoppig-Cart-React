## Overview

### The challenge

- First was to find the optimised way to use CSS in this project rather then using whole lot of code use specific mesurement units and also grid in it.

- Since its an react project i have faced an challange while transering data(**props**) from one components to another.

- Also managing state in react application

### What I learned

Learn About use of Props in react applicaption 

```JavaScript 

<> export function CartItem(props) {
  const { id, productName, price, productImage } = props.data; </> 
```
```ShopContext
const { cartItems, addToCart, removeFromCart, updateCartItemCount } =
    useContext(ShopContext);
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources
